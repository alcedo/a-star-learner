What is our project about?

This project is about using Kinect for the better good of mankind. Okay, to phrase it simply, itâ€™s to try to solve any problems that are currently existing in any system. Our group has adopted the idea of trying to help autistic children in their learning in terms of their social inhibition as well as their mental cognitive skills. Since the start of our project, our group has been focusing on finding out more about how to better adapt our project to suit the needs of both the teachers, as well as the autistic children. We are learning new things every week and that is what this blog and our project is about. To learn and to help others.
